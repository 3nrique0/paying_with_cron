I sometimes need to surveil some tasks on a QSE by distance or monitor my resource consumption in a common server.
Therefore I needed to create some automated way of doing it.

The path and username will be deliverately named $USER and $path
For the noobs, the variables in UPPER-CASE belong to the system, wheres lower-case are given by the user.

 Please be welcome to use/copy and request details about the usage. Since this is a personal repository for a specific QSE system, things may variate, with pleasure I'll help make things more... generic.

 Enjoy !!
